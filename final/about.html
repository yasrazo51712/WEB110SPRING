            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio was born March 10th, 1994 in Vega Baja, 
                Puerto Rico. His father was a truck driver, and his mother taught English.
                 Benito sang in his catholic church choir until the age of 13. He then decided 
                 to concentrate on making his own beats. In order to support his studies at the 
                 University of Puerto Rico’s Arecibo campus, he bagged groceries at a local Econo 
                 supermarket. He began releasing music on sound cloud where his song Diles blew up 
                 and producers began to call. </p>
                 <p>The reason behind his artistic name “Bad Bunny” is because as a little boy he has
                     to dress up as a bunny and the picture taken shows him with an annoyed face. He 
                     figured the name would market well, as people would be reminded of him when seeing a bunny. </p>
            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>In 2020, his album El Ultimo Tour Del Mundo became the first all-Spanish album to debut at No.1 on the
                 Billboard 200. He repeated this with his album Un Verano Sin Ti in 2022. Benito has been a guest 
                 performer for the Super Bowl, won multiple awards including songwriter of the year as well as 5 Latin Grammys.
                  He has also been named on of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world.</p>
            <h2>Activism</h2>
            <p>A lot of Bad Bunny’s music contains socially conscious messages.</p>
            <p>After Hurricane Maria, he tried to capture Puerto Ricos spirit with “Estamos Bien”. When he performed 
                the song on the Tonight Show he reminded the audience that a lot of Puerto Rico still had no power from the hurricane.
                 He also performed wearing a shirt and a skirt to bring awareness to the murder of a trans woman in Puerto Rico. 
                 With his song solo de mi, Bad Bunny address domestic violence in Latin America. During COVID he performed while riding
                  on top of a truck in New York and serenaded health workers at Harlem Hospital. He also protested against Puerto Rico
                   Governor Ricardo Rosello after test messages revealed he was being sexist and homophobic. His newest album is a love
                    letter to his home Puerto Rico. In a short film, audiences witness the affects of gentrification in Puerto Rico Henan 
                    elders man is unable to order typical island food. In track 14 of DTMF, titled Lo que le paso a hawaii he references
                     how gentrification ruined Hawaiis culture and how it is starting to happen in Puerto Rico</p>
