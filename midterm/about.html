        <p>About Me</P>
        <h1>My name is Yasmin Razo-Alatorre. I was born and raised in Kansas City. I am currently a student at Johnson County Community College, majoring in Marketing.
             I love to travel and learn about new cultures. I am bilingual and can speak English and Spanish fluently, and working towards learning portuguese next.</h1>
        <h1>In my free time I enjoy working on creative activities like painting, or photo editing. I also enjoy watching soccer games and binge watching series on Netflix.</H1>
    <h1>My goal is to finish my degree and create a marketing firm. I want to be able to travel and work at the same time.</h1>
    <h1>It took me a while to discover my interest in marketing. I first began my college education as a nursing major, and eventhough I gained caretaking skills, I relized it was not for me. 
        I then switched to an interior design major, which I loved but I felt like it was not the right fit for me either. After working in the customer service and construction industry for a few years,
        I realized that I loved helping others and being able to see the results of my work. This led me to discover my interest for marketing. I love the idea of being able to help others grow their business and 
        be able to use my creativity to create ideas and campaigns to help them.
